    <h1>Introduction to Chemistry</h1>

    <h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>

    <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, and how substances combine or separate to form other substances. It’s commonly known as the <i>central science</i> because it bridges physics and biology. In this field, <u>chemical reactions</u> are a major focus.</p>

    <p>In chemistry, a <dfn>chemical reaction</dfn> is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Formula Example</h3>
    <p>One of the most common reactions is the combination of hydrogen <sub>2</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen <sub>2</sub> (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>

    <h3>Variables in Chemistry</h3>
    <p>In chemical equations, variables like <var>n</var> (number of moles), <var>V</var> (volume), and <var>T</var> (temperature) are used to describe the system's state.</p>

    <h4>Avogadro's Number</h4>
    <p>Avogadro's number is 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>, which represents the number of atoms or molecules in one mole of a substance.</p>
